# Espionage

## Cloning
You should know the drill...

## Code Conventions
Most of our code base follows the normal sbox .editorconfig, except for a few things.

### Private Members

## Asset Conventions

### Models

Models must adhere to this naming convention in order to avoid confusion later down the line and when other members work
on assets.

#### World Models

All world model "Models" must be prefixed with the `w_` identifier. This tell us that this model is intended to be used
in the world, and not used as a hero asset.

#### View Models

All view model "Models" must be prefixed with the `v_` identifier. This tells us that this model is intended to be used
as a view model.
